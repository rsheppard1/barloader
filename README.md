# Powerlifting Plate Loading Calculator

A web application for powerlifters to visually calculate what plates to load on the barbell.  It works in both directions: users can select plates to visually load the bar and see the total weight, or they can enter a target weight and the app will show them which plates to use.

## Features

*   **Visual Plate Loading:** Click plates to add them to the barbell visualisation.  The total weight is automatically calculated.
*   **Target Weight Calculation:** Enter a target weight, and the app will determine the necessary plate combinations.
*   **Bar Weight Selection:** Choose the barbell weight.
*   **Collar Option:** Specify whether competition collars are being used.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimised for mobile devices.
